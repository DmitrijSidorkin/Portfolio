        I have a strong foundation in HTML, CSS, Javascript, React and
        Typescript, acquired through various online courses and hands-on
        projects, and further strengthened by taking part in Sourcery Academy
        for Front-End, where I have also familiarized myself with Agile
        methodologies working in a team. Besides that, I had an opportunity to
        work with some back-end technologies such as Express, Node.js and
        MongoDB, and am well familiar with version control tools like Git as I
        have incorporated them in personal and team projects throughout my
        journey as a front-end developer.
